# User Stories for EasyCreate

This is a backlog of user stories for EasyCreate, an AI-powered tool that converts website layout images into interactive React code. The tool aims to streamline the frontend development process by automatically generating code while allowing users to specify interactive elements and customize the implementation.

## Current Features

These are the core features that will be highlighted on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a developer, I want to upload an image of a website design and receive corresponding React component code, so I can quickly start implementing the layout without writing boilerplate code.

2. As a designer, I want to specify which elements in my design should be interactive (buttons, links, forms), so the generated code includes proper event handlers and state management.

3. As a frontend developer, I want to customize the styling framework (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components) for the generated code, so it integrates smoothly with my existing project setup.

### Other Features

1. As a developer, I want to organize the generated components in a hierarchical structure, so the code follows clean architecture principles and is maintainable.

2. As a user, I want to preview the generated React components in real-time, so I can verify the implementation matches my design before downloading the code.

3. As a developer, I want to export the generated code in a project-ready format with proper file structure and dependencies, so I can quickly integrate it into my development workflow.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a developer, I want to specify responsive design breakpoints in the generated code, so the components adapt appropriately to different screen sizes.

2. As a team lead, I want to save and share generated components with my team members, enabling collaborative development and consistency across projects.

3. As a developer, I want to customize the naming conventions and code style of generated components, ensuring they align with my team's coding standards.

4. As a designer, I want to annotate specific areas of my design with special requirements or notes, guiding the AI in generating more accurate code.

5. As a developer, I want to import existing component libraries (Material-UI, Chakra) and have the AI utilize them in the generated code.

6. As a user, I want to modify the generated code directly in the browser and see live updates, enabling quick iterations and refinements.

7. As a developer, I want to specify accessibility requirements for interactive elements, ensuring the generated code follows WCAG guidelines.

8. As a team member, I want to version control my generated components, tracking changes and reverting to previous versions if needed.

9. As a developer, I want to extract and reuse specific components from larger layouts, enabling modular development practices.

10. As a user, I want to generate unit tests along with the components, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

11. As a developer, I want to specify state management requirements (Redux, Context API), so the generated code includes proper state handling.

12. As a designer, I want to upload multiple design variations and generate corresponding component variants, streamlining the implementation of different states or themes.

13. As a developer, I want to integrate the generated components with backend APIs by specifying data requirements and endpoints.

14. As a user, I want to receive suggestions for optimizing the component structure and performance based on best practices.

15. As a developer, I want to generate documentation for the components, including props, usage examples, and dependencies.
